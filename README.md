# Mission-to-Mars
This is a web-scrapping project to gather relevant and up to date information on Marsa and the NASA mission to mars. This project utilizes HTML, Python, MongoDB, and Jupyter notebook to create a functional local website to scrap the most recent news on mars as well as images from the red plant and a general set of facts.
